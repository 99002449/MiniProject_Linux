## Title : Bank - Withdraw/Deposit and Query solving

The two service that is Withdrawing/Depositing the amount in the cash counter or Query raising included in this system are implemented successfully. The two threads have been created in the system, One thread is created to handle customer’s who are either withdrawing or depositing the amount and provide service accordingly. The second thread is created to handle customer’s who come’s up with the query in the bank. Hence both the service can be executed parallel by making use of threads and mutex overcomes the problem of race condition.
- [ ] The system shall be create thread for each customer requests.
- [ ] Two different threads are created to either withdraw/deposit or solve the query in parallel.
- [ ] The system shall overcome the race-condition and deadlock scenario’s.
- [ ] The concept of mutex shall overcome the race-condition situation.
